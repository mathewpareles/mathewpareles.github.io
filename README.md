## Superconductivity Research


The goal of my Master's thesis was to discover a new class of superconducting material. We showed that it's easier to create the conditions for superconductivity in rotationally symmetric materials than in arbitrary materials. 
Here are some of the materials I studied (drawn in Reciprocal Space).

We found that you can tune the materials to create spikes in the density of states (DOS) which can lead to instabilities in the material, including topological superconductivity.

## LLM Interpretability Research

I also researched the exact circuitry that GPT-3 uses to solve algebraic equations. Specifically, we wanted to show that GPT-3 was learning simple attention patterns like the "Induction Head", and didn't have an internal representation of the task. 
We found strong evidence for this. As you provide GPT-3 with more of a hint, its performance increases linearly, without a sharp increase as one might expect.

## Quantum Computing Research


In my undergrad at Cornell, I researched ways of using Quantum Computers to solve Partial Differential Equations including the Heat, Advection, and Burger's Equations. I created simulations that can run on IBM's Quantum Computer. Here are some of my results. The Heat Equation (left) can accurately be solved on a quantum computer, while the Advection Equation (right) cannot due to discretization errors.
