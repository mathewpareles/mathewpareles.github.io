## Superconductivity Research


The goal of my Master's thesis was to discover a new class of superconducting material. We showed that it's easier to create the conditions for superconductivity in rotationally symmetric materials than in arbitrary materials. 
Here are some of the materials I studied (drawn in Reciprocal Space).

When you calculate the Energy Spectrum of these materials there are spikes in the DOS (right side of below plot). This leads to instabilities in the material, including topological superconductivity.

## LLM Interpretability Research

I also researched the exact circuitry that GPT-3 uses to solve algebraic equations. Specifically, we wanted to show that GPT-3 was learning simple attention patterns like the "Induction Head", and didn't have an internal representation of the task. 
We found strong evidence for this - as you provide GPT-3 with more of a hint on how to solve the problem, GPT-3's performance increases linearly, without sharp increase as one might expect.

## Quantum Computing Research


In my undergrad at Cornell, I researched ways of using Quantum Computers to solve Partial Differential Equations including the Heat, Advection, and Burger's Equations. Here's one of my simulations of the Heat Equation. The code runs on IBM's Quantum Computer.
